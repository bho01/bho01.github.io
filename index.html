          I am a high school student currently developing android applications in my free time. My programming journey sprung up in middle school, when a friend of mine introduced the subject to me. I was interested immediately. I taught myself how to program javascript with the help of books, websites, and other great programmers in my school. My first completed project was a little game on Khan Academy which was created in JavaScript. Before becoming an Android developer, I wanted to become web developer. So in my free time, I made small websites and projects that were primarily web based. But when I attended my first hackathon, MHacks, my team and I built an app that tracked finances. It was at that point I became interested in mobile app development. Initially, I started as an Android Developer, creating apps in Java. Eventually, I found React-Native; a JavaScript Library which enables devleopers to develop native apps with JavaScript. Currently I am a fresh React-Native Developer in my own time and a web developer at a gym called Newell Strength. The people at the gym are extremely friendly, the staff is awesome and the program is beneficial. I would highly recommend going there if you live in the area. I lean towards JavaScript as my favorite languate since it is prevalent everywhere: node.js, frontend, React-Native, etc. However I have some knowledge in Java as well.

          <br>
          Besides typing lines of code in my free time, I am a musician and an ultimate frisbee player.
        <br>
        <br>
          I plan to continue computer science despite the obstacles and challanges that might come with it. As for the future, I hope to expand my knowledge in the subject and developing more applications; possibly in the iOS platform as well.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ultimately, my main goal in life is to help the community around me and the world in which I live in. I strive to achieve that by improving the object that most of the people in this world own to this day: an internet-connected device.
