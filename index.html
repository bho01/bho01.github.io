          My name is Brendon Ho and I am a self-taught iOS developer writing applications in my free time. Developing and programming was always a passion that I had ever since I started in middle school. I have a good understanding of mobile application development (Android, iOS, Java, Swift, Kotlin) and web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). In addition, I love to learn new technologies and tools that come out such as react-native and electron, both of which I tried out. I will definitely continue to program and expand my knowledge in computer-science.
                  <br>
                  <br>
          Besides typing lines of code in my free time, I am a musician and an ultimate frisbee player.
                  <br>
                  <br>
          Ultimately, my main goal in life is to help the community around me and the world in which I live in. I strive to achieve that by improving the object that most of the people in this world own to this day: an internet-connected device.
